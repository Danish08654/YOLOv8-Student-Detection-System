Excited to share my recent work on YOLO Object Detection, where I built a complete end-to-end pipeline for detecting objects in real-time with high accuracy.
 Project Intro:
The goal of this project was to build a fast and accurate object detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once).
 I implemented this to detect person, achieving real-time performance and strong detection accuracy.
How It Works:
1)Preprocessed dataset and annotated images
 2) Trained a YOLO model using transfer learning
 3) Optimized the training pipeline (augmentation, hyperparameters, class balancing)
 4) Evaluated performance using precision, recall, mAP
 5) Deployed the model for real-time inference
Skills / Tools Used:
1)React.js
2) Python
 3) YOLOv5 / YOLOv8
 4) OpenCV
 5) PyTorch
 6) Jupyter Notebook
 7 CNNs
 8) Data Augmentation / Evaluation Metrics
